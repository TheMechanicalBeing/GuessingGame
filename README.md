# C

This is my first C project.

It's easy to code and implement this project.

But remember, you become great by solving little parts together.

### About Project

The project is console application, about Store that "stores" and sells its products.

When you run the code you can use commands:

* 'h' - outputs description about commands information
* 'a' - lets user add product's name and price
* 'l' - lists store items with its index, product name and price
* 'p' - lets use to purchase product considering item's price (in USD) and quantities
* 't' - outputs information about how much money did user spend
* 'q' - quits application
